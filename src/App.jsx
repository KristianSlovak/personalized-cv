          Before becoming a Green Fox Academy student, I worked in a pet shop
          warehouse. I sought to change careers because I did not see a way for
          my personal and career growth. I have always enjoyed working with
          computers in various ways, including building them and learning how
          they operate. GFA strengthened my enthusiasm for coding, as I enjoy
          problem-solving, critical thinking, and gaining knowledge of new
          technologies.
